## Content Page Widgets
The Extension also includes two widgets which can be inserted into the custom pages on your site. These widgets
allow you to show the various options available to potential customers by either setting a static amount in the plugin's
configuration, or by showing a text box that would allow the customer to enter an amount and instantly receive the details of their
payment plan on that basis.

The steps to implement this feature are explained below:

1. Click on `Content` and then `Pages` in the submenu in your administration panel.
2. Click on `Select` and then `Edit` in the submenu in the row corresponding to the page you wish to add the widget, or alternatively
click the `Add New Page` button if you'd like the widget to feature on a new page.
3. Click on the down arrow adjacent to the `Content` header to expand that section, then place the cursor where you would like the
widget to appear in the text editor and select the `Insert Widget` icon at the top left area of the editor.
4. Select either *Divido Block Widget* or *Divido Popup Widget* from the `Widget Type` selection list
5. Enter a default amount that the widget will calculate within the `Default Amount` widget option
6. Choose to either show a text box, allowing customers to enter an amount which will dynamically calculate their potential plan, or
hide this option by selecting No in the `Show text box?` widget option
7. Click on the Insert Widget button at the bottom right
8. Click on the `Save Page` button on the top right.

Providing you have an API key inserted in your Setup (see above) the widget should now be displaying in the page you have edited/created.

Please note that the Widgets will stretch to 100% of the width of its container, so you may wish to enclose the widget within a
`table column` or `div` if you would like to inhibit the width.

## Dev Tips
It might be a good idea to disable caching in the system configuration for development.
1. In the admin left panel go to `SYSTEM -> Cache Management` and then click on the dropdown menu in the upper-left corner and pick `Disable`, then select everything and click `Submit`
